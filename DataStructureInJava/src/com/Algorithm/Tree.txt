Tree:
	Non linear data Structure;
	hierarchical representation among elements.

	Node: each elements of tree
	Edge:connecting line of nodes
	Parent Node: Immediate Predecessor of a Node.
	Child Node: Immediate Successor of a Node.
	Root Node: Not having any parent Node.
	Leaf Node: Node does not have any child Node.
	Level: Distance of a node from root.
	Height: total level of Tree.
	Sibling Node: having same parent.
	Degree: number of immediate child Node.

Binary Tree:
	Maximum number of node 2^i  where i>=0;
	Height h,max number of node possible 2^h-1;
	Height h,minimum number of nodes possible 1;
	Binary Tree having n nodes,maximum height possibe n,Minimum height will be log(n+1):base 2;
	if non empty b tree,n=number of nodes,e=umber of edges then e=n-1;
